            <div class="grey-content">In the deployment pipeline pattern, every change in version control triggers a process (usually in a CI server)
              which creates deployable packages and runs automated unit tests and other validations such as static code analysis.
              This first step is optimized so that it takes only a few minutes to run. If this initial commit stage fails,
              the problem must be fixed immediately—nobody should check in more work on a broken commit stage. Every passing
              commit stage triggers the next step in the pipeline, which might consist of a more comprehensive set of automated
              tests.

              App Autoscaler is a marketplace service that ensures app performance and helps control the cost of running apps.

              To balance app performance and cost, Space Developers and Space Managers can use App Autoscaler to do the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Configure rules that adjust instance counts based on metrics thresholds such as CPU Usage</li>
                <li>Modify the maximum and minimum number of instances for an app, either manually or following a schedule</li>

              that is not live: in this example, Green. Once you have deployed and fully tested the software in Green, you switch
              the router so all incoming requests now go to Green instead of Blue. Green is now live, and Blue is idle.

    <md-card-title>Accelerating the digitization</md-card-title>
    <md-card-subtitle>
      For some executives, digital is a new way of engaging with customers. For others, it’s about technology. It’s tempting to
      look for simple definitions, but to be meaningful and sustainable, We believe that digital should be seen less as a
      thing and more a way of doing things. To help make this definition more concrete, we have broken it down into three
      attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>creating value at the new frontiers of the business world,</li>
        <li>creating value in the processes that execute a vision of customer experiences,</li>
        <li>and building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.</li>
      </ul>
      The main focus is on the third part of the definition - "building foundational capabilities that
      support the entire structure". <a href="https://docs.lab.idugalic.pro/">Read more ...</a>
